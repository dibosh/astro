## 0.0.* - 2017-11-11 ~ 2017-11-24
So many other things happened, including my father's death(2017-11-18).
I don't really remember what improvements I made then- mostly structuring up,
setting up server, the initial design and architecture planning and styleguide
decisions were made. I can never start on a project unless until I have a little
bit of those things done. Sigh!
